# Climacrux

[Climacrux](https://climacrux.com/) was founded with the purpose of bringing down atmospheric CO₂ levels.

To achieve this, Climacrux has decided to focus on atmospheric CO₂ removal (CDR), launching projects to accelerate adoption and make the CDR market easier to access.

## Our projects

- [Carbon Removed](https://carbonremoved.com/) - Carbon removal subscriptions & one-time purchases for consumers & businesses.
- [CDR Platform](https://cdrplatform.com/) - An API to integrate CDR directly into business processes and services and enable a net-zero future.
